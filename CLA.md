DaoCLI uses various agreements to accept contributions of software code and documentation from individuals and corporations, and to accept larger grants of existing software products.

These agreements help us achieve our goal of providing reliable and long-lived software products through collaborative, open-source software development. In all cases, contributors retain full rights to use their original contributions for any other purpose outside of DaoCLI, while providing the DaoCLI and its projects the right to distribute and build upon their work.

The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to DaoCLI and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software. An individual must have submitted a signed CLA to the DaoCLI before we give them commit/merge rights to any DaoCLI project. This agreement language is very standard and has been originally cloned from other open source projects in the ecosystem.

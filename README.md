## Programmatic & Embedded DAOs for AI Agents and Modern Web3 Applications


daoCLI is a toolkit built for AI agents to create and manage programmatic & embedded DAOs on Solana. Traditional DAOs require human interfaces, separate websites, and manual governance - making them unsuitable for AI-driven operations. daoCLI solves this by providing a CLI-first, programmatic approach that enables AI agents to create, manage, and interact with DAOs directly through code.

**We are like Stripe...we are developer first. Because AI Agents are developer first**.

## 🌟 Why daoCLI?

For Developers | For Users | For Investors
---------------|-----------|---------------
CLI-first approach | Stay in your product ecosystem | Direct exposure to DAO performance
Full automation support | Seamless token interactions | Liquid secondary market
Git & CI/CD integration | No platform switching | Real-time price discovery
Programmatic control | Integrated trading interface | Transparent mechanics

## 🤖 Why AI Agents Need daoCLI

Traditional DAOs | daoCLI for AI
----------------|---------------
Requires human interfaces | Pure programmatic interaction
Manual governance through websites | Automated governance through code
Separate platforms & websites | Embedded directly in applications
High operational overhead | Minimal computational overhead
Human-centric UX | API-first design

## 🎯 Core Features for AI Agents

### Programmatic Control
- **API-First Design**: Every feature accessible through code
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: React to on-chain events automatically
- **Automated Decision Making**: Implement algorithmic governance
- **Batch Operations**: Handle multiple DAOs efficiently

### AI Integration Features
- **Standardized Interfaces**: Consistent API patterns for easy integration
- **Deterministic Outcomes**: Predictable results for AI decision making
- **State Management**: Track DAO state programmatically
- **Event Subscriptions**: Real-time updates for AI agents

### Treasury Management
- **Automated Trading**: Algorithmic market making
- **Smart Rebalancing**: AI-driven portfolio management
- **Risk Parameters**: Programmable constraints
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics

## 🚀 Quick Start for AI Integration

### Basic Setup
```bash
# Install daoCLI
npm install -g daocli

# Initialize DAO programmatically
daocli init --agent-key YOUR_AI_AGENT_KEY

# Create DAO with AI management
daocli create-dao \
  --target 1000 \
  --ai-manager YOUR_AI_MANAGER \
  --strategy-path ./ai_strategy.json

# Setup automated trading
daocli setup-trading \
  --strategy algorithmic \
  --risk-params ./risk_config.json
```

### Detailed CLI Usage

1. First, ensure you have a proper configuration in `dao-config.jsonnet`

2. Initialize the DAO:
```bash
./dao-cli.js init -t 1000 -m 0.1 -d 30
```
- `-t`: Fundraising target in SOL
- `-m`: Minimum price in SOL
- `-d`: Duration in days

3. Create the liquidity pool:
```bash
./dao-cli.js create-pool -s 100 -t 1000000
```
- `-s`: Initial SOL amount
- `-t`: Initial token amount

4. Stake LP tokens:
```bash
./dao-cli.js stake -a 1000
```
- `-a`: Amount of LP tokens to stake

Each command can be automated and integrated into AI workflows through the programmatic API.

### Complete CLI Reference

```bash
# Basic DAO Operations
daocli create-dao --target 1000 --name "MyDAO"
daocli setup-pool --sol 10 --tokens 1000000
daocli deploy --network mainnet
daocli set-permissions --address YOUR_ADDRESS

# AI Agent Operations
daocli set-agent --key YOUR_AI_KEY --permissions "TRADE,GOVERN"
daocli configure-agent --strategy ./strategy.json
daocli monitor-agent --metrics "performance,risk"

# Advanced Operations
daocli update-params --config ./new_params.json
daocli view-analytics --format json
daocli export-state --output ./state.json

# Management Commands
daocli list-daos --filter "active"
daocli show-permissions --dao DAO_ADDRESS
daocli backup-config --path ./backup
```

Each command supports both human and programmatic interaction, with AI agents typically using the programmatic API for automation.

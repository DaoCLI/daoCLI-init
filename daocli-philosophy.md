# A Node-Based Solution to DAO Orchestration: The daoCLI Protocol

By The daoCLI Team
August 2024

## 1. Abstract

The evolution of Web3 governance confronts pivotal challenges such as network fragmentation, DAO interoperability constraints, cross-chain integration complexities, and security vulnerabilities. To address these issues, we introduce the daoCLI Protocol—an orchestration and verification engine that seamlessly integrates permissionless and composable functions across multiple blockchain networks within the DAO lifecycle. By transforming both on-chain and off-chain functions into execution kernels, daoCLI offers a distributed runtime environment that optimizes resource utilization, enhances modularity, and accelerates deployment. This approach not only improves the responsiveness of decentralized applications (dApps) but also reduces their time-to-market. Our proposal positions daoCLI as part of the fabric of the Web3 framework.

## 2. Motivation

The Web3 ecosystem faces several significant challenges in DAO operations, including fragmentation, scalability limitations, cross-chain friction, and security concerns.

**Fragmentation**: The emergence of numerous Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions has led to the creation of isolated DAOs. This fragmentation impedes seamless interaction between governance systems and smart contracts across different environments, undermining the foundational principle of composability in decentralized systems.

**Scalability Constraints**: any chain grapples with network congestion and high gas fees. These scalability issues deter the widespread adoption of DAOs and erode user experience.

**Cross-Chain Friction**: Facilitating interoperability between any chain and other blockchains often demands intricate integrations. The absence of standardized cross-chain communication protocols exacerbates development complexities, stifling innovation and efficiency.

**Security Vulnerabilities**: Ensuring transaction integrity, provenance, and security in a decentralized manner remains a challenge. The proliferation of bridges and interoperability solutions introduces novel attack vectors, heightening security risks.

## 3. TL;DR

DAO Orchestration refers to the approach of dividing and distributing the execution of DAO operations across multiple blockchain networks, or "shards", to enhance scalability and efficiency in blockchain systems. Instead of executing every governance action on a single chain, DAO orchestration allows governance operations to be distributed across multiple chains, each handling a portion of the overall workload.

DAO orchestration is critical for any chain's scalability. The daoCLI Protocol integrates permissionless and composable kernels (governance shards) across multiple networks, seamlessly into the native any chain transaction lifecycle.

daoCLI manages resources to provide a secure and optimal execution environment for DAO operations. This enables a distributed runtime environment that determines governance outcome based on specified kernels, operating across different environments. daoCLI's open framework enhances modularity, optimizes resources, ensures stable operations, and accelerates deployment, ultimately improving responsiveness and reducing time to market for applications.

## 4. Introducing Kernels

Within the daoCLI Protocol framework, kernels represent governance shards. These kernels transform both on-chain and off-chain functions into modular units characterized by the following attributes:

* **Statelessness**: Kernels maintain no intrinsic state, ensuring flexibility and facilitating seamless migration across environments.
* **Lightweight Design**: To minimize computational overhead, kernels promote efficient execution.
* **Resilience**: Engineered to withstand operational failures, ensuring reliable performance.
* **Independent Deployability**: Allowing for deployment across various environments.

The defining features of kernels include:

* **Infrastructure Agnosticism**: Kernels are not tethered to specific infrastructures; they possess the agility to migrate across environments as necessitated.
* **Enhanced Modularity and Composability**: By decompartmentalizing DAO operations into discrete kernels, modularity is enhanced, enabling permissionless sharing across multiple applications.
* **Accelerated Deployment**: Simplifying the deployment process improves responsiveness and reduces time-to-market for applications.

## 5. Vision

The Pre-DAO Paradigm

Before programmable DAOs, developers bore the burden of constructing, operating, and maintaining all governance infrastructure. This paradigm engendered prohibitive costs, scalability constraints, accessibility challenges, and resource limitations. Cross-chain DAO operations revolutionized this landscape, but introduced fractured governance where governance mechanisms are handled by separate chains and protocols.



### daoCLI's Transformative Potential

daoCLI seeks to catalyze a comparable paradigm shift within the Web3 domain—a permissionless Web3 DAO environment built by the community through contributions of monetizable kernels. This vision aligns with the Functions as a Service (FaaS) model, reimagined to suit the decentralized and heterogeneous fabric of blockchain ecosystems.

## 6. Core Concepts

### The Computing Engine

daoCLI enhances an any chain Remote Procedure Call (RPC) node with a verification and orchestration-enabled computing engine. This engine abstracts the intricacies associated with integrating cross-chain DAO interdependencies.

The computing engine creates an application and technology agnostic framework that offers a runtime environment to user applications in a distributed manner. It sits between a transaction initiated on any chain and its propagation into a block, determining a transaction's outcome based on the kernels selected. This approach allows for flexible, efficient scaling and optimization of distributed DAO operations.

### Proof of Governance (PoG)

PoG validates that prescribed kernels have run successfully before a transaction is executed, ensuring reliability and security of the daoCLI Protocol.

The daoCLI Protocol achieves this by utilizing various schemes including a decentralized token authority that issues a signature token, ERC-1271 cryptography and proof systems. The implementation requires the application developer to implement a Software Development Kit (SDK) as well as the token authority. PoG works with existing standards within the any chain ecosystem, combining multiple schemes to ensure an anti-fragile system.

### Decentralized Registry

An any chain-based registry for activating and monetizing community-built kernels. This registry serves as the definitive repository, maintaining critical information about registered kernels, including their pathways, monetization schemes, and other customizable parameters. Core to the design of daoCLI is the concept of a two-sided marketplace where kernels are built and monetized, while being utilized by applications across Web3.

### Use Case Scenario

In a hypothetical scenario, a DeFi protocol on any chain would like to allow users to create and manage DAOs if they are an approved user on Chain A (and if not, to reject the creation request). Say Chain A has built an authentication platform on Chain B, with dynamic off-chain metadata corresponding to approved users. Additionally, these users need to have an approval score of X as determined by a verification contract on Chain C. In the past, implementing these solutions across various chains would have required multiple complex integrations and in many cases require direct communication with vendors. However, with daoCLI, builders now only need to perform a single, one-time permissionless integration.

## 8. Decentralization and Security Considerations

### Upholding Decentralization 

daoCLI leverages the intrinsic decentralization of existing native blockchains. By integrating with a standard any chain RPC node, any any chain RPC node can function as a daoCLI node without interfering with consensus mechanisms of the underlying network. Node operators are incentivized through the accrual of a proportion of fees generated from kernels, fostering a decentralized and participatory ecosystem.

### Mitigating Malicious Activities

To prevent and mitigate potential malicious activities, such as replicating daoCLI node code to fabricate counterfeit signatures, daoCLI employs multiple cryptographic schemes that ensure security by design. The security architecture is flexible, customizable, and predominantly under the control of the dApp developer. This approach ensures that the daoCLI Protocol remains permissionless, resilient, and secure.

## 9. Technical Implementation

### Kernel Development
```typescript
import { KernelManager } from '@daocli/core'

async function setupKernel() {
  const kernel = new KernelManager({
    chain: 'any chain',
    permissions: ['GOVERNANCE', 'TREASURY'],
    validators: ['0x...']
  })

  // Execute governance actions
  await kernel.executeProposal({
    type: 'UPGRADE',
    params: { newVersion: '2.0.0' }
  })
}
```

### Cross-Chain Integration
```typescript
import { CrossChainBridge } from '@daocli/bridge'

async function bridgeGovernance() {
  const bridge = new CrossChainBridge({
    sourceChain: 'any chain',
    targetChain: 'solana',
    protocol: 'wormhole'
  })

  // Bridge governance action
  await bridge.sendAction({
    type: 'VOTE',
    payload: {
      proposalId: '123',
      vote: 'FOR'
    }
  })
